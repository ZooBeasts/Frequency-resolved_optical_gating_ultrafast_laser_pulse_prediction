# Ultrafast_laser_FROG_Prediction
This is the collaboration project for ultrafast laser pulse response prediction between Heriot-Watt University and University of St Andrews 

This is the mock model code for the paper, as the paper states using the encoder-decoder model, the performance is roughly the same as using Resnet. 
Code shared for people to do similar projects without any troubles, load, and use for anyone.
